# Surf's Up

## Overview/Purpose:

Before opening a surf shop / ice cream shop in Oahu, Hawaii, a potential investor would like an analysis done on temperature trends in the area of Oahu, Hawaii.  Due to a previous attempt this investor had with opening a surf shop, their main concern is specifically the temperature trends of the months of June and December in Oahu.  Based on the results of this analysis this investor would be able to determine if they are willing to invest in this surf shop / ice cream shop.


## Results: Three key differences in the weather between June and December...

1. The mean temp deviates by 3.9 degrees, 71.0 degrees in December and 74.9 degrees in June.
2. The min temp deviates by 8 degrees, 56 degrees in December and 64 degrees in June.
3. The max temp deviates by 2 degrees, 83 degrees in December and 85 degrees in June.

## Summary: 

Since the weather tempuratures in June and December are very similar, this suggests that it may not have been the weather that impacted this interested investors attempt to open a surf shop.  My initial thought would be to add additional analysis based on past years.  You could do the months of June and December for a few years past.  Also, doing the full year could shine a light on the months the shop could adjust to the atmosphere.  Checking on vacation trends in that area, possibly what vacationers purchase.  Adding this type of analysis could show the interested investor how serious you are to being successful.  

By doing an analysis of all the months in the year could determine if other options of rentals, such as bike rentals, surf lessons or just apparel would sell.  Also, for the slower months create a small cafe experience with chairs and tables outside and inside, could help with the months that are cooler.  Also adding other food items, dry snacks and sell ponchos/sweatshirts for those cold and rainy days.  During Christmas time have Christmas cookies, beverages... offering water, sodas and hot beverages can also attempt to attract potential consumers.  

However, starting off as a surf shop / ice cream shop, with more analysis creates confidence in your ideas making the investor more keen to invest.  If not, offering to work on additional analysis such as popular tourist months, advertising, offering first time offer coupons/drink cards.. etc.  At least some of these ideas could spark better ideas and show potential investors how excited and willing you are to open this shop.
